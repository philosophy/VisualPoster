        <div class="title">
            <p>We put our credit policy up on the web so it's
                super clear on how things work.
             </p>
        </div>
        <div class="desc-wrapper">
            <h3>NEW CUSTOMERS:</h3>
            <p>To keep things simple, we ask for the first 3 orders to be
                COD. This is a firm policy, that keeps prices low and
                enables us to set a appropriate credit limit for your ongoing
                needs.
            </p>
            <p>On the 4th order, as long as you fill in our simple application
                form, and pass a credit check, your credit is good for 30 days.
                This is a tight 30.

            <h3>HOUNDING:</h3>
            <p>About the only way to get our "dark" side is to mess us around
                with the money situation.
            </p>
            <p>97% of our customers pay on time, but if you are one of the unlucky
                3% who elect to drag us out, we'll hound you with great regularity.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="desc-wrapper">
            <h3>SUSPENSION OF CREDIT:</h3>
            <p>If we have to hound you on more than one occassion, it's usually our
                policy to stop the credit tap and (politely) ask you to take a hike.
            </p>
            <p>We don't normally name names, but it would have to be quite a <a class="external-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.shock.com.au">shock</a>,
                if this were to happen.
