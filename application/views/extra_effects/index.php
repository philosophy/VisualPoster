            <p><b>Ahhhh!</b> So you have been paying attention!
                This is the page for the "special" people,
                if you want ordinary - best not read further.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do all of these "in house", but allow an extra
                day so we can delight you with our efficiency.

            <h3>Spot UV Coating - $160ex Flat Surcharge</h3>
            <p>Adds texture and depth to backgrounds and brings out
                amazing levels of colour on text. Works perfectly with

            <h3>UV Gloss - $110ex Flat Surcharge</h3>
            <p>UV Gloss is perfect when you have rich photographic detail,
                bubblegum bright colours or you want your poster to
                jump out from all the others. This is the "vogue" magazine
                treatment - so shiny you'll feel like <b><a class="fancy-img" href="assets/image/lib/extraeffects/steamywindow.jpg">Kate Winslett</a></b> in
                Titanic when you run your hands over it.

            <h3>Golden Gayville - $175ex Flat Surcharge</h3>
            <p>Gold Ink actually has a real metallic hue, and to make it
                RICH we apply it twice in a row. This is good for the
            </p>
            <p>"Ye Olde" effect and also when text is the prominent
                focus of your poster. If text is the prominent focus,
                you should use gayville as well as UV Gloss, because
                that looks unbelivably good.

            <h3>Silver Sensation- $175ex Flat Surcharge</h3>
            <p>Silver Ink is the obvious choice when you have a robotic,
                metallic theme or for large numbers. You have to be careful
                with silver, as if the text is too thin (see second example) it's
                impossible to read from poster viewing distance, so large
                chunk text is best. It's really nifty when you want to achieve
                an "industrial", "space" or "urban" theme too.
