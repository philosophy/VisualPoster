            <p>It's easy to get confused with the many sizes and options
                of poster available, so here's some helpful ideas :
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="desc-wrapper">
            <h3>A2 Posters (Printed on 150gsm Glossy or Matte)</h3>
            <p>A2 Posters are our most popular poster, because of their versatility.</p>
            <?php echo image_asset('lib/a2-posters.jpg', '', array('class'=>'img-desc', 'id' => 'a2-poster')); ?>
            <p>You'll see them often clustered on walls inside cafes, record stores, small bars, bookstores
                backpacker, venues, streetwear shops and budget accommodation centres.
                These are also glued on construction sites, dedicated wall spaces, sideboards
                and scaffolding around the city and public transport throughfares.
                They are almost always "full colour", and are 90% of these are glossy.
                <b>The artwork on these works best is it's dramatic, loud and clear to understand, there's a lot of competition in this space!</b>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="desc-wrapper">
            <h3>A3 Posters (Printed on 150gsm Glossy or Matte)</h3>
            <p>A3 Posters are a great choice when budget is a primary concern.
                They go in all the same places as A2 posters do, except outdoors, due to size.
                Because they are smaller, more outlets will accept them, making them cheaper and easier to distribute, and it's the only poster size that's practical for most shop window pin-ups.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="desc-wrapper">
            <?php echo image_asset('lib/posters.jpg', '', array('class'=>'img-desc', 'id' => 'mix-posters')); ?>
            <h3>A1 Posters (Printed on 150gsm Glossy or Matte)</h3>
            <p>A1&#39;s are the high impact outdoorstreet poster. These are in full colour, of substanial size to
                have impact and enable you to have a ton of space coverage when you want to
                get your message across.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="desc-wrapper">
            <h3>Pole Posters</h3>
            <p>Overseas, Pole Posters are extremely popular, but locally, they are especially contentious.
                They have relatively small usage due a lack of distributors, but often can be used
                in many of the same sites as A2 and A1 posters.
            </p>
            <p>Councils are known to target pole posters with <?php echo anchor('assets/image/lib/herecomestrouble.jpg', 'particular aggression,', array('class'=>'fancy-img')); ?>
                which may account for the medium's limited popularity.
            </p>
            <p>Pole Posters are most commonly used in Sydney and distributed the week of the show and perhaps the week
                prior also if budget allows. The legalities of pole postering are determined by each local government
                council and thus vary across the country. It is best to check with the venues as to what you
                can do in their area as in some municipalities they are illegal and they will certainly be cut
                down and you risk the possibility of being fined!

        <div class="desc-wrapper">
            <h3>One Sheeters to Four Sheeters</h3>
            <p>One-Sheeters are used on the street in Railway Underpasses, Billboards,
                Hoardings and High-Traffic Areas. This is the domain of the "message"
                poster and is usually used where you are promoted a known band with
                specific time and place.
            </p>
            <p>Two-Sheeters are used around the city and in high traffic areas.
                These are used predominently when you are looking for saturation
                coverage. The advantage of this poster is that it will get your target
                audience talking - it's impossible to miss, even when driving or
                from a tram or train window.
            </p>
            <p>Four-Sheeters are the godzilla of posters, and use in only promiment
                locations. Because of the fiddly nature of these and the high distribution
                costs, four sheeter campaigns are mainly used for political/commercial
                messages or big budget projects.
            </p>
            <p>All 1,2 and 4 Sheeters are printed on a thin coated or uncoated paper.
                Coated paper gives a photographic appearance but is more fiddly to
                stick up. Uncoated is a rough, butcher like texture more suited to patterns
                but will stick to anything,
            </p>
            <p>The size of 1 sheeters can vary by 15% depending on the supplier.
                We give you the choice! You can choose the smaller size when
                budget is paramount or the larger when you want the biggest
                poster money can buy.
            </p>
