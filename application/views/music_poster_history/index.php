        <div class="desc-wrapper">
            <p>For over two hundred years, posters have been displayed
                in public places all over the world. Visually striking,
                they have been designed to attract the attention of passers-by,
                making us aware of a political viewpoint, enticing us to attend
                specific events, or encouraging us to buy.
            </p>
            <p>Although many people may not realise it, we're currently
                in the third wave of a poster renaissance, from a music
                poster perspective.

            <span class="block">The First Wave : <b>Boxing Posters</b>.</span>
            <p>Concert posters date back to the 1940s and ‘50s,
                and were mainly straightforward designs, bold and
                purposely simple, dominated by negative space.
            </p>
            <p>Incorporating simple block lettering with unadorned
                photographs of the performers, they were unchanged
                from the days of the big bands of the 1930's.
            </p>
            <p>Not many of these posters remain, and that's probably the side effect
                of the fact that they pretty much all looked the same and as such,
                weren't always valued for collectability.

            <p>The Second Wave : <b>Silk Screening / Screenprinting</b></p>
            <p>Silk Screening came into its own around the start of
                the 70's.
            </p>
            <p>In 1968, art students from several parisian colleges
                barricaded themselves in, during violent student protests
                and created hundreds of graphics that spewed through the street.
            </p>
            <p>Poster scholar Gene Marie Tempest interviewed several of the
                key participants, and learned that the first poster, Usines,
                Universités, Union (“Factories, Universities, Union”),
                was a lithograph and it took all afternoon to make 30 copies.
            </p>
            <p>This clearly wouldn’t do, and they turned to an
                “American technique”: silkscreening.
            </p>
            <p>Silkscreening didn't require expensive machinery, complicated
                equipment, and an unskilled "helper" could produce 100-200
                posters an hour.
            </p>
            <p>Almost exactly the same scenario played out in America in 1969
                as Harvard campus erupted over conflicts with the campus administration.
                From there, it spread like wildfile - Mexico City, Boston, Berlin, Cuba—
                tiny workshops cranked out untold numbers of posters and street graphics.
            </p>
            <p>Music Promoters were quick to notice the practical effect of these
                posters, and in San Francisco with the birth of the dance concert,
                a rock poster accompanied almost every show that was put on during that era.
                Informal arrangements between the promoters and the artists gave the poster artist
                more liberty than most commercial enterprises would have permitted.
            </p>
            <p>At the time, edgy bands outside the norms were not played on any radio station,
                and the only way you could advertise their shows, was by hanging posters in the streets.
                For some categories of music, this still remains the case today.
            </p>
            <p>Soon, people began pulling the posters off of the telephone poles, almost as quickly as they were put up, and promoters started to give them out at the end of shows to advertise the next week's show.
            </p>

            <p>By the late 80's however, screenprinting slowly crept into decline, overtaken by other
                mediums, and combined with a reduction in record label budgets, the responsibility
                for procuring creative promotional materials slowly shifted to the musicians themselves.
            </p>
            <p>Limited-edition silk-screened posters declined in favour of low cost prints made on
                Xerox machines in local libraries, or at Copy Shops.
            </p>
            <p>They were glued to buildings and phone poles surreptitiously at night by kids in the scene.
                In this pre-computer era, the flyers were, for lack of a better comparison, "the MySpace of the '80s".

        <div class="desc-wrapper">
            <p>The Third Wave : <b>Offset Printing</b></p>
            <p>The main technological breakthrough we now have is that offset printing is the
                cheapest it's ever been, and the previous break-even point of 5,000 prints are is
                now just 500.
            </p>
            <p>More importantly, there is a rich design pool or designers all over the world
                available to craft a masterpiece, often with only a few days notice.
            </p>
            <p>Following a long exodus, street and cafe posters are getting unprecendented
                response rates when good artwork is used and demand from fans for these
                kinds of tokens is apparent.
            </p>
            <p>Many bands and promoters see posters strictly as a promotion tool.
                It is important for that, but it can be so much more, when designed
                with memorabilia in mind.
            </p>
            <p>Music is such a passionate thing for so many people. To have something visually that you like,
                that has a name of a band you like from a show you went to that was a good night—
                it’s a great token of the evening, an an untapped resource for bands balancing
                budget.
