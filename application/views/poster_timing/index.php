            <p>One of the most frequently asked questions when making
                posters revolves around timing and distribution.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some recommendations of when posters should
                appear on the street, based on both industry experiences
                and the recommendations of various distributors :

        <div class="desc-wrapper">
            <h3>1 Sheeters - 4 Sheeters</h3>
            <span class="block">- 1 Week Prior to the Show</span>
            <span class="block">(2 Weeks if Budget Allows)</span>
            <span class="block">Recommended Quantity : (100 per Week) Melbourne, (150 per Week) Sydney.</span>
            <p>Generally, 1 Sheeters will list ALL the dates of shows across the country,
                so there is only one design.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="desc-wrapper">
            <h3>A2 and A3 Posters</h3>
            <span class="block">- 2-3 Weeks Prior to the Show</span>
            <span class="block">Recommended Quantity : (400 for Melbourne and Sydney) (200 for Brisbane and Perth)</span>
            <p>A2 and A3 posters are at least 30-40% more effective if they are "Venue Specific".
                If budget doesn't allow this to happen, a white space where the venue is handwritten
                or stamped is a decent workaround.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="desc-wrapper">
            <h3>Pole Posters</h3>
            <span class="block">- 10 days Prior to Show</span>
            <span class="block">Recommended Quantity : (600 per week Sydney) (200 per Week Melbourne)</span>
